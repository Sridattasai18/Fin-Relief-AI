## About

FinRelief AI is an intelligent, AI-powered web application that helps people struggling with loan payments figure out a realistic settlement amount and uses AI to write a professional negotiation letter to their bank — turning financial stress into an actionable plan.

Most debt management tools either overwhelm you with jargon or give you generic advice that doesn't reflect your actual situation. FinRelief AI takes a different approach: it looks at your real numbers, shows you exactly where you stand, and helps you take action.

---

## Core Scenarios

The platform is built around three core scenarios:

**Scenario 1 — AI-Powered Settlement Recommendation**
Analyzes your financial profile (loan details, EMI, overdue duration, monthly income) to compute a personalized debt stress score, debt-to-income ratio, and a realistic One Time Settlement (OTS) percentage — a concrete starting point before you ever speak to your bank.

**Scenario 2 — Intelligent Negotiation Letter Generation**
Uses Google Gemini AI to generate a professional, lender-specific OTS negotiation letter based on your financial standing. If Gemini is unavailable or over quota, the app falls back to a built-in professional template automatically — you always get a usable letter.

**Scenario 3 — Financial Health Tracking & Loan Analysis**
A dashboard that tracks monthly surplus, DTI ratio, debt stress levels, and settlement percentages over time, alongside your full AI negotiation letter history.

## How It Helps

Negotiating debt on your own is intimidating. Most people don't know what a realistic settlement looks like, and they don't know how to put one in writing. FinRelief AI removes both barriers.

By the time you walk into a conversation with your bank, you already know your numbers, you have a defensible settlement figure, and you have a professionally written letter in hand. The dashboard also tracks your stress score over time so you can see real progress as your situation changes.

## Who It Is For

Individuals in India dealing with personal loans, credit card debt, or other consumer lending products who are finding regular repayments difficult — particularly anyone already overdue and considering approaching their lender for a settlement.

## How It Is Built

The application is split into two completely decoupled services that communicate over a standard REST API.

The **backend** is a Python API built with FastAPI. It handles authentication with JWT tokens, debt stress calculations, Gemini AI integration, PDF generation via ReportLab, and all database reads and writes. The production database is Neon serverless PostgreSQL; SQLite is used for the isolated test suite.

The **frontend** is a React SPA built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS v4. It renders dashboard trend charts using Recharts, manages authenticated API calls through Axios, and provides the full UI for adding loans, viewing metrics, simulating settlements, and generating and downloading OTS letters as PDFs.

The frontend only ever talks to the backend through JSON API calls — the backend never serves HTML. This makes it straightforward to deploy them independently (backend on Render, frontend on Vercel) and scale either one without touching the other.
